# Linen - A Starter Theme for Ghost

**Get started making great Ghost themes with Linen!**

This is a *starter theme* for Ghost, and is not intended to be used as-is on any site or blog.

Linen is a sensible collection of default styles and templates that can be mixed, matched, removed or refactored to create a unique Ghost theme.

Linen is created and maintained by *[Theme Spectre](http://themespectre.com/linen)*

## Installation

(More detailed installation instructions coming soon, I promise)

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js
2. Ruby
3. Sass
4. Grunt


### Setup

Clone (or fork) this repository into your /content/themes/ folder in Ghost.

Run `npm install` in the linen directory to install grunt modules.

Run `grunt` to build the Sass files, or `grunt watch` when you are ready to start themeing.


### Build

To build a .zip file of your theme for distribution, run:

`grunt bundle --name=yourthemename`

The *build* folder will contain the necessary theme files, and the *dist* folder will contain a .zip file of your theme that you can distribute and use in other Ghost instances.

==============
"Abstract" is a clean, modern Wordpress theme written to the web standards of 2004. 

"Abstract-Ghost" is a rewrite of Abstract for the Ghost publishing platform (https://ghost.org) that attempts to follow the best coding standards of today, which I will learn as I go along.
